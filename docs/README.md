## ⌨️ Hotkeys & Shortcuts

Here’s where the magic happens!  
Below is a table of the most useful hotkeys and what they do.

### Hotstrings

## Coming Soon:

- **Cukoo Alerts**: Stay on track, beat time blindness  
- **Focused Alerts**: Never miss an important notification  
- **Focus Timer**: Customizable, non-intrusive focus sessions

### Cukoo Alerts: Audible Hourly Reminders

Many of us suffer from Time Blindness, which is a common symptom of ADHD. Time blindness is the inability to judge the passage of time. This can be a major source of stress and anxiety for many people. The Cukoo Alerts feature is designed to help you stay on track and manage your time more effectively. You can set up reminders to alert you when a certain amount of time has passed. This can help you stay focused and on task, and prevent you from getting lost in time.

### Focused Alerts

Ever missed an alert because you were too focused on a task? The Focused Alerts feature is designed to help you stay on top of your alerts and notifications. This feature will blank out your screen and display a full screen notification (and sound) when you receive an alert on Outlook, Teams, or other applications. This can help you stay focused and on task, and prevent you from missing important alerts.

### Focus Timer

Using Pomodoro timers suck. It's hard to stay focused when you're constantly being interrupted by timers. The Focus Timer feature is designed to help you stay focused and on task. This feature will allow you to set up a timer that will alert you when it's time to take a break. You can customize the length of the timer and the type of alert you receive. This can help you stay focused and on task, and prevent you from getting lost in time.
